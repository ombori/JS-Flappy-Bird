# Ombori Grid Flappy Bird with Remote
This Flappy Bird implementation has the option to have a mobile remote that controls the "flaps" of the game. You can read all about the implementation on our [documentation website](https://developer.omborigrid.com/).

The game itself is forked and not created by Ombori. Check the [original](https://github.com/aaarafat/JS-Flappy-Bird) if you want the un-altered code.
